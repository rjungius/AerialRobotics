Exercise 1: Cascaded PID control
==================================

In this exercise, you will learn how to tune a cascaded PID controller for the CrazyFlie (**control.py**). 
As seen in the lecture, it takes a position and yaw setpoint as an input and generates pwm signals for the motors as output:

Task overview
-------------

For this task you will learn how to systematically tune each layer of the cascaded controller and thus improve the overall performance.
To start, make sure that you are in **main.py**, **exp_num = 1** and **control_style = "path_planner"**. You can now run the simulation on webots (**crazyflie_world_excercise**) and you should see a badly tuned controller flying through a parcour, marked by four spheres.
Note that webots tells you how long it takes the drone to complete the task: With the initial gains this is roughly 18 s.

If tuned well, you will end up with a much better performance, completing the parcour below 12 s.

Exercise
---------
The key to a successful tuning is to start from a stable state: first you need to make sure that your drone can keep an altitude. This requires tuning the PID responsible for z-velocity as well as the one for z-position.
1. Start by opening **control.py** and change the variable **self.tuning_level = "vel_z"**.
This will now send step inputs for z-velocity to your drone. 
After two iterations, a plot displays the most important metrics for tuning:
  - Rise time: How long it takes the system to reach the reference. This should be as short as possible.
  - Overshoot: How much your system exceeds the reference after reaching it. This should stay within a certain range (we suggest less than 10%).
  - Steady state error: Your system might not converge fully to your reference within a period of the step function. This should stay within a certain range (we suggest less than 5%).

As a general rule of thumb, we propose the following strategy: 
- Start with a small P and I,D = 0.
- Increase P until you see an overshoot.
- Increase D until the overshoot vanishes (D is usually smaller than P).
- Repeat last two steps until increasing D does no longer stabilize your system and leads to oscillatory behaviour.
- Reduce P by 20% and adapt D accordingly. This ensures robust behaviour when operating in unforseen cases (e.g. roll and pitch at the same time). If this is not respected, you might end up with unexpected behaviour (e.g. oscillations) when tuning higher levels.
- If nescessary, increase I to counteract steady state error: e.g. on "vel_z" to counteract gravity, or on "vel_xy" to counteract drag).

This should lead you to similar performance:

2. Now you can do the same for z-position by switching **self.tuning_level = "pos_z"**. Once you are done, your drone can hover in a stable manner, allowing tuning the other gains.
3. In a cascaded controller higher levels send references to lower ones. That's why you always tune from the bottom up.
- **self.tuning_level = "rate_rp"**
- **self.tuning_level = "rate_y"**
- **self.tuning_level = "att"**
- **self.tuning_level = "vel_xy"**
- **self.tuning_level = "vel_z"** (retuning might improve performance since lower levels have changed now)
- **self.tuning_level = "pos_xy"**
- **self.tuning_level = "pos_z"** (retuning might improve performance since lower levels have changed now)

Once you are happy with your gains, you can disable tuning (**self.tuning_level = "off"**).
Please send your gains and best time to **simon.jeger@epfl.ch** with the subject "exercise 1".
We will keep a live score board during the exercise session.

Bonus challenge
---------------
The references that are sent through the cascaded control architecture are capped to make your drone more stable (e.g. when you request a roll rate of 3 [rad/s], it still send a maximum reference of 2 [rad/s]).
For faster flight, you can increase the maximum reference by adapting **self.limits**. You might have to adjust your gains to adapt to the new limits.

Our best time is 9.5 s. Let the fastest drone win!
